One of the main differences between macros and functions is that functions use type checkers while macros don't, which can trigger errors.
One of the cases where they would get different results with this operation:

function:

int square(int val) { return val*val; }
    int result = square(2+ 3);
    Console.WriteLine(result);

    //print 25

macro:

#define square(val) (val*val)
    int result = square(2 + 3);
    printf("function %d", result);

    // print 11

As we can see in the function we get 25 which would be the expected result, in the macro we get 11 which is a result of the operation 2 + 3 * 2 + 3 which although 
it is not incorrect is normally not the expected result therefore the functions They give better results and a safer code.
